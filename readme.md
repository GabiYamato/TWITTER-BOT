# Twitter Bot Detection

## Goal

The goal of this project is to develop and evaluate methods for detecting bot accounts on Twitter. Automated accounts, or "bots," can manipulate online discourse, spread misinformation, and impact social network dynamics. Accurate bot detection is crucial for maintaining the integrity of online platforms and ensuring authentic user interactions.

## Dataset: TWIBOT-22

TWIBOT-22 is a large-scale, publicly available dataset designed specifically for Twitter bot detection research. It addresses the limitations of previous datasets by providing a comprehensive, diverse, and realistic collection of Twitter user profiles, including both bots and genuine human accounts.
